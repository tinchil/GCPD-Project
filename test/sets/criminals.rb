His arsenal of weapons includes razor-cards, acid-spewing flowers, and fatal laughing-gas. He is responsible for countless deaths but has also been certified as insane for legal proceedings.")
      @catwoman    = FactoryBot.create(:criminal, first_name: "Selina", last_name: "Kyle", aka: "Catwoman", convicted_felon: true, notes: "Selina Kyle is an accomplished jewel thief.

      @hush        = FactoryBot.create(:criminal, first_name: "Thomas", last_name: "Elliot", aka: "Hush", convicted_felon: true, notes: "Being a victim of abuse rendered Thomas Elliot sociopathic. Before even his teenage years, he was already operating on a high level of sociopathy, going so far as severing the brake line of his parents' car to gain independence from them and inherit the Elliot family fortune. Dr. Thomas Wayne operated on and saved his mother, foiling the young Elliot's plan of parricide. One of the finest surgeons in Gotham City, Thomas Elliot has an incredible, genius-level intellect and is also a master planner, with tactical skills rivaling those of the Caped Crusader. Hush's greatest asset is his talent for thinking like his opponents and for using their abilities against them. Hush is also an expert marksman.")

      @deathstroke = FactoryBot.create(:criminal, first_name: "Slade", last_name: "Wilson", aka: "Deathstroke", convicted_felon: true, enhanced_powers: true, notes: "Chosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create metahuman super soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders. Slade Wilson's physical and mental attributes have been enhanced as a result of the experimental serum he was given; he possesses heightened strength, agility, durability, and reflexes, and has the ability to utilize up to 90 percent of his brain capacity. Deathstroke also possesses a regenerative healing factor that enables him to recover from physical injury much more rapidly than a normal human; it does, however, have its limits, as it could not heal his missing eye nor can it regenerate entire limbs. This enhanced endurance enables him to survive otherwise fatal injuries, though recovering from such injuries renders him temporarily insane and ferociously animalistic. In addition to being a tactical genius with years of military experience, Deathstroke is an expert in many forms of unarmed combat and martial arts as well, serving as a master of B≈çjutsu, Boxing, Jojutsu, Judo, Jujitsu, Karate, and Ninjutsu.")

He obsessively searched for a way to cure her, until an industrial accident caused by a greedy business executive turned Fries into a mutant who can only survive in subzero temperatures.")

Ra's al Ghul is the founder of the League of Assassins. Ra's' greatest tools are his Lazarus Pits, which heal any injury including recent death and restore the user back to the prime of life, but cause temporary insanity. His constant exposure to the pits have granted him slightly enhanced endurance, strength, and healing but also comes with the price of a gradual onset of insanity if overused. Due to his expanded life span, Ra's has accumulated a vast knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, chemistry, detective artistry, physics, and martial arts. He has also gained many international contacts and a vast fortune over the course of centuries.")
      @scarecrow   = FactoryBot.create(:criminal, first_name: "Jonathan", last_name: "Crane", aka: "Scarecrow", convicted_felon: true, enhanced_powers: true, notes: "Professor Jonathan Crane was an outcast in childhood due to the constant bullying, until he grew up to face his fears as a psychologist and biochemist in the specialization of fear.
